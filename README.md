_Instruction Set Processor_
This project implements a simple instruction set processor with a user-friendly web interface. The processor supports basic arithmetic operations 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on 8-bit binary numbers including opcode and operands. It demonstrates the loading of data from memory to registers,
performing operations, and storing results back in memory.

**Getting Started**
